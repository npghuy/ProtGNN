# Report information
The report file is from my final project of graph mining class. It has two parts: 
- With the first part, we introduce some algorithms of graph mining to solve problems of graph classification, link prediction, graph indexing and community detection and perform its example. 
- With the second part, we introduce XAI methods in graph learning, ProtGNN - Prototype Graph Neural Network. It is a Self-Explaining Graph Neural Networks, that combines prototype learning with GNNs and provides a new perspective on the explanations of GNNs.
