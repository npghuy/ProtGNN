# Report information
The report file is from my final project for the graph mining class. It has two parts: 
- In the first part, we introduce some algorithms of graph mining to solve problems of graph classification, link prediction, graph indexing, and community detection and perform their examples. 
- In the second part, we introduce XAI methods in graph learning, ProtGNN - Prototype Graph Neural Network. It is a Self-Explaining Graph Neural Network, that combines prototype learning with GNNs and provides a new perspective on the explanations of GNNs. After describing ProtGNN/ProtGNN+, We try to implement again experiments on the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00911) and make experimental Evaluation.
